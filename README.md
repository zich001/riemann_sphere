#Stereographic Mapping of 2D NxN plane on Blender

Instructions:
1. Create a 2d NxN plane on blender where N is the ratio between the plane created and a blender unit-plane.
2. Substiute SF=N to the variable SF (Real)
3. Split cut the 2d plane in Edit Mode (The more the cuts, the higher the resolution of the sphere projected)
4. Use blender script edit and paste the code, run the code by clicking Alt+P (Option+P for MacOS)
5. Use the shape-keys tab of blender and change the value of sphere_001 key. (By default it is set to 0 initially).1 Stands for stereographic projection, 0 stands for ordinary 2d-euclidean plane.
